SELECT description FROM crime_scene_reports WHERE month = 7 AND day = 28  AND street = "Chamberlin Street";

-- read description  that said :

-- Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Chamberlin Street courthouse.
-- Interviews were conducted today with three witnesses who were present at the time â€”
-- each of their interview transcripts mentions the courthouse.

-- so wee read interviews for finding their name and explain about what their watched in 2020/07/28 and  place = courthouse (name and transcript )


SELECT name, transcript  FROM interviews WHERE month = 7 AND day = 28 AND transcript LIKE "%courthouse%";


-- name    | transcript

-- Ruth    | Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car
--           in the courthouse parking lot and drive away. If you have security footage from
--           the courthouse parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

-- Eugene  | I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning,
--           before I arrived at the courthouse, I was walking by the ATM on Fifer Street and saw
--           the thief there withdrawing some money.

-- Raymond | As the thief was leaving the courthouse, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute.
--           In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
--           The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.

-- so first of all we find license_plates that left about 10 minute after theft and check atm_transactions in the morning
-- in this day that did withdraw and check phone_calls less than 1 minute to a person


-- find the   thief acording ti these specificis:

WITH
      find_license_plate AS (
      SELECT license_plate FROM courthouse_security_logs WHERE month = 7 AND day = 28 AND hour = 10 AND minute BETWEEN 10 AND 20 ),

      find_account_number AS (
      SELECT account_number FROM atm_transactions WHERE month = 7 AND day = 28 AND atm_location = "Fifer Street" AND transaction_type = "withdraw"),

      find_phone_calls AS (
      SELECT caller FROM phone_calls WHERE month = 7 AND day = 28 ),

      find_person_id AS (
      SELECT person_id FROM bank_accounts WHERE account_number IN find_account_number )


-- After that we search for  finding  a name of theft according to these information

      SELECT * FROM people WHERE id IN find_person_id  AND license_plate IN find_license_plate AND phone_number IN find_phone_calls;

-- then  we find name of theft
