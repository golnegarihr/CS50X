                Band Darre Dam is a huge building of stone, brick and mortar of Sarooj which was built on the flood route in Bagheran Mountains.
                This dam is the most important historical site in Birjand. The dam formed small lakes that could be used as a vacation spot.
                The dam construction has been formed from grooves on the sedimentary floors of the river bed.In addition to the large diameter of the wall
                that increased its strength, the architect used two tricks to enhance the wall's strength.First the construction of two bays with a width of
                about 1.80 meters and a rise of about five meters, will increase the strength of the wall.These two trailers are located on both sides of the
                emergency evacuation channel.
