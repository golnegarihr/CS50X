                    site in Birjand. The dam formed small lakes that could be used as a vacation spot.The dam construction has been formed from grooves on the sedimentary floors of the river
                    bed.In addition to the large diameter of the wall that increased its strength, the architect used two tricks to enhance the wall's strength.First the construction of two
                    bays with a width of about 1.80 meters and a rise of about five meters, will increase the strength of the wall.These two trailers are located on both sides of the emergency
                    evacuation channel.
